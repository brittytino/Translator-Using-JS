## Welcome to the Language Translator App!

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ If you're here, you're probably curious about this cool Language Translator App. Well, you're in luck because this app lets you translate text from one language to many others. Let's dive into what makes this app awesome!

### What Can You Do?

- **Translate**: You can type in some text in one language and choose which other languages you want it translated into. It's like having a multilingual superpower!
  
- **Copy & Paste**: Need to use that translated text somewhere else? No problemo! Just hit the "Copy" button, and you're good to go.
  
- **Listen Up**: Want to hear how the translated text sounds? With the magic of "Text-to-Speech," you can listen to it too! How cool is that?

### How It Works

This app is made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it super easy to use. Plus, it connects to a free translation API to work its magic. Don't worry about the tech stuff; just enjoy the translations!

### Getting Started

Using the app is a piece of cake:

1. Type in your text.
2. Choose the original language.
3. Pick the languages you want to translate into.
4. Hit the "Translate" button.
5. Voila! Your translated text appears.
6. Want to copy it? Just click the "Copy" button.
7. Feeling adventurous? Click "Text-to-Speech" to hear it.

Oh, and don't forget to replace the placeholder API keys with the real ones. Check out the API docs for that.
